# fluxbox-pin-in-menu
Small script that allows to pin/unpin applications chosen from .desktop files to the top of the fluxbox menu, for faster access


Note: to run .desktop files directly from Fluxbox menu, this script creates a hidden file in your home folder: ".desktop-run.sh.", that you can use to execute .desktop files from the command line.
